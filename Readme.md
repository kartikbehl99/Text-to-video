# ABOUT:
Most of us will remember, how boring the classes were in school! Students get bored when teachers read out passages from textbook, but are more enthusiastic to watch videos and pictures. Teachers may not have resources to create videos of relevant topics. So, we have created an automatic video generator which creates a video from an image of text/chapter. The video will be the narration of the while showing images relevant to the current paragraph thereby making learning fun and interesting. Students will retain knowledge much better by associating pictures to information.

# HOW TO RUN:
1. Intall the required packages using pip install.
2. Save the image of your desired text in the current directory by the name "sample.jpg"
3. Open terminal and type "python text_to_videobook.py" 
4. Wait for the program to generate pdf from the image using OCR.
5. After that the program will generate video from the pdf which will be saved by the name "sample.mp4"
